# Snake Game

The classic arcade snake game where a player controls a snake and eats apples to grow in length. If the player runs in to the window border, or into him/her self - the game is over. The player's snake length increases by one for every red blob he/she eats - the red blob is meant to represent an apple.

The above image shows a frame from a typical game. The players snake can be seen, as well as the next apple (red blob) the player needs to eat. Additionally, a score counter on the top keeps track of the players current score - which is just how many apples he/she has collected so far. 

The game was coded in Java. 

## Motivation 

I really enjoyed playing this game as a child - it was the only thing I had on my phone and it really helped me pass the time and have fun. I started learning GUI in Java independently, with the goal being coding this game. It took some time, but after about a month of consistent learning I managed to code it and achieved the goal I set for myself.
